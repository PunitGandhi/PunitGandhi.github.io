      abstract = {In many drylands around the globe, vegetation self-organizes into regular spatial patterns in response to aridity stress. We consider the regularly-spaced vegetation bands, on gentle hill-slopes, that survive low rainfall conditions by harvesting additional stormwater from upslope low-infiltration bare zones. We are interested in the robustness of this pattern formation survival mechanism to changes in rainfall variability. For this, we use a flow-kick modeling framework that treats storms as instantaneous kicks to the soil water. The positive feedbacks in the storm-level hydrology, that act to concentrate water within the vegetation bands, are captured through the spatial profiles of the soil water kicks. Between storms, the soil water and vegetation, modeled by a two-component reaction-diffusion system, evolve together. We use a combination of linear stability analysis and numerical simulation to compare predictions of idealized periodic rainfall, with no variability, to predictions when there is randomness in the timing and magnitude of water input from storms. We show that including these random elements leads to a decrease in the parameter range over which patterns appear. This suggests that an increase in storm variability, even with the same mean annual rainfall, may negatively impact the resilience of these pattern-forming dryland ecosystems.}

abstract = {The accurate quantification of symmetry is a key goal in biological inquiries because symmetry can affect biological performance and can reveal insights into development and evolutionary history. Recently, we proposed a versatile measure of symmetry, transformation information (TI), which provides an entropy-based measure of deviations from exact symmetry with respect to a parameterized family of transformations. Here we develop this measure further to quantify approximate symmetries and maximal symmetries represented by critical points in TI as a function of a transformation parameter. This framework allows us to characterize the evolution of symmetry by tracking qualitative changes with respect to these critical points. We apply TI to increasingly complex settings, from mathematically tractable probability distributions to differential equation models with emergent behaviors that are inspired by developmental biology and formulated in both static and growing domains. Our analysis of the qualitative changes in symmetry properties indicates a potential pathway toward a general mathematical framework for characterizing symmetry transitions akin to bifurcation theory for dynamical systems. The results reveal deep connections between observed symmetry transitions, subtle changes in morphology, and the underlying mechanisms that govern the dynamics of the system.}

    abstract = { Abstract. We develop a model for investigating the impact of rainstorm variability on the formation of banded vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. Water input, during rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water. The redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the impact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed. These two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the fast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic reaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with soil water and biomass. This pulsed-precipitation model predicts that the preferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic distance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into the soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast ecohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation pattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain inputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland pattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical low annual mean. Model simulations suggest, for instance, that shorter rainy seasons and greater variability in storm depth may both hasten ecosystem collapse. }

    abstract = { Virtually all forms of life, from single-cell eukaryotes to complex, highly differentiated multicellular organisms, exhibit a property referred to as symmetry. However, precise measures of symmetry are often difficult to formulate and apply in a meaningful way to biological systems, where symmetries and asymmetries can be dynamic and transient, or be visually apparent but not reliably quantifiable using standard measures from mathematics and physics. Here, we present and illustrate a novel measure that draws on concepts from information theory to quantify the degree of symmetry, enabling the identification of approximate symmetries that may be present in a pattern or a biological image. We apply the measure to rotation, reflection and translation symmetries in patterns produced by a Turing model, as well as natural objects (algae, flowers and leaves). This method of symmetry quantification is unbiased and rigorous, and requires minimal manual processing compared to alternative measures. The proposed method is therefore a useful tool for comparison and identification of symmetries in biological systems, with potential future applications to symmetries that arise during development, as observed in vivo or as produced by mathematical models.

    abstract = { Center manifold reduction is a standard technique in bifurcation theory, reducing the essential features of local bifurcations to equations in a small number of variables corresponding to critical eigenvalues. This method can be applied to admissible differential equations for a network, but it bears no obvious relation to the network structure. A fully inhomogeneous network is one in which all nodes and couplings can be different. For this class of networks, there are general circumstances in which the center manifold reduced equations inherit a network structure of their own. This structure arises by decomposing the network into path components, which connect to each other in a feedforward manner. Critical eigenvalues can then be associated with specific components, and the network structure on the center manifold depends on how these critical components connect within the network. This observation is used to analyze codimension-1 and codimension-2 local bifurcations. For codimension-1, only one critical component is involved, and generic local bifurcations are saddle-node and standard Hopf. For codimension-2, we focus on the case when one component is downstream from the other in the feedforward structure. This gives rise to four cases: steady or Hopf upstream combined with steady or Hopf downstream. Here the generic bifurcations, within the realm of network-admissible equations, differ significantly from generic codimension-2 bifurcations in a general dynamical system. In each case, we derive singularity-theoretic normal forms and unfoldings, present bifurcation diagrams, and tabulate the bifurcating states and their stabilities. }

abstract = {From infiltration of water into the soil during rainstorms to seasonal plant growth and death, the ecohydrological processes that are thought to be relevant to the formation of banded vegetation patterns in drylands occur across multiple timescales. We propose a new fast–slow switching model in order to capture these processes on appropriate timescales within a conceptual modeling framework based on reaction–advection–diffusion equations. The fast system captures hydrological processes that occur on minute to hour timescales during and shortly after major rainstorms, assuming a fixed vegetation distribution. These include key feedbacks between vegetation biomass and downhill surface water transport, as well as between biomass and infiltration rate. The slow system acts between rain events, on a timescale of days to months, and evolves vegetation and soil moisture. Modeling processes at the appropriate timescales allows parameter values to be set by the actual processes they capture. This reduces the number of parameters that are chosen expressly to fit pattern characteristics, or to artificially slow down fast processes by the orders of magnitude required to align their timescales with the biomass dynamics. We explore the fast–slow switching model through numerical simulation on a one-dimensional hillslope, and find agreement with certain observations about the pattern formation phenomenon, including band spacing and upslope colonization rates. We also find that the predicted soil moisture dynamics are consistent with time series data that has been collected at a banded vegetation site. This fast–slow model framework introduces a tool for investigating the possible impact of changes to frequency and intensity of rain events in dryland ecosystems.}

In many cases, these vegetation bands are arced, with field observations suggesting a link between the orientation of arcing relative to the grade and the curvature of the underlying terrain. We modify the water transport in the Klausmeier model of water–biomass interactions, originally posed on a uniform hillslope, to qualitatively capture the influence of terrain curvature on the vegetation patterns. Numerical simulations of this modified model indicate that the vegetation bands arc convex-downslope when growing on top of a ridge, and convex-upslope when growing in a valley. This behaviour is consistent with observations from remote sensing data that we present here. Model simulations show further that whether bands grow on ridges, valleys or both depends on the precipitation level. A survey of three banded vegetation sites, each with a different aridity level, indicates qualitatively similar behaviour. }

The combination of these two phenomena in different forms has a significant impact on the behavior of ecosystems in changing environments. One notable case is connected to tristability of two distinct uniform states together with patterned states, which has recently been found in model studies of dryland ecosystems. Using a simple model, we determine the extent of tristability in parameter space, explore its effects on the system dynamics, and consider its implications for state transitions or regime shifts. We analyze the bifurcation structure of model solutions that describe uniform states, periodic patterns, and hybrid states between the former two. We map out the parameter space where these states exist, and note how the different states interact with each other. We further focus on two special implications with ecological significance, breakdown of the snaking range and complex fronts. We find that the organization of the hybrid states within a homoclinic snaking structure breaks down as it meets a Maxwell point where simple fronts are stationary. We also discover a new series of complex fronts between the uniform states, each with its own velocity. We conclude with a brief discussion of the significance of these findings for the dynamics of regime shifts and their potential control.},

These regions are well described by an asymptotic theory based on the wavelength nucleation/annihilation time near the boundaries of the pinning region. The resulting theory leads to predictions that are qualitatively correct and, in some cases, provide quantitative agreement with numerical simulations. }

  abstract = {The theory of stationary spatially localized patterns in dissipative systems driven by time-independent forcing is well developed. With time-periodic forcing, related but time-dependent structures may result. These may consist of breathing localized patterns, or states that grow for part of the cycle via nucleation of new wavelengths of the pattern followed by wavelength annihilation during the remainder of the cycle. These two competing processes lead to a complex phase diagram whose structure is a consequence of a series of resonances between the nucleation time and the forcing period. The resulting diagram is computed for the periodically forced quadratic-cubic Swift–Hohenberg equation, and its details are interpreted in terms of the properties of the depinning transition for the fronts bounding the localized state on either side. The results are expected to shed light on localized states in a large variety of periodically driven systems.}

In particular, we probe the regimes of applicability of three models of the wire: stiff and massless, elastic and massless, and elastic and massive. Using both analytical and empirical techniques, we present the conditions under which the wire's mass and elasticity can be neglected. By accounting for these effects, we measure Nichrome's thermal expansion coefficient to be 17.1(1.3) μm/m⋅K, which is consistent with the accepted value at the 8\% level.},

  abstract = {A longitudinally and transversely coherent, high repetition rate x-ray source with widely tunable wavelength is desired for a variety of experimental applications. A free electron laser (FEL) powered by an electron beam from a superconducting linac can reach the desired peak and average x-ray power levels with transverse coherence. However, generating longitudinally coherent x-ray pulses is a significant challenge, especially at high repetition rate. This paper presents a one-dimensional theoretical and numerical investigation of a method to achieve longitudinal coherence and high repetition rate simultaneously. We propose a “radiator-first” configuration, wherein an FEL oscillator follows a high gain harmonic generation (HGHG) FEL. The oscillator generates seed power that is directed upstream to initiate the HGHG process in a following electron bunch. This configuration allows for the generation of radiation at short wavelength, which is highly sensitive to energy spread, to occur before the longer wavelength oscillator, whose performance is not seriously degraded by the beam heating in the upstream radiator. The dynamics and stability of this radiator-first scheme is explored analytically and numerically. A single-pass, 1D map is derived using a semianalytic model for FEL gain and saturation. Iteration of the map is shown to be in good agreement with simulations. A numerical example is presented for a soft x-ray FEL.}

abstract={The generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation is used to study the persistence and decay of localized patterns in the presence of time-periodic parametric forcing in one and two dimensions. A localized state that was stable with constant forcing may begin to breathe under periodic forcing, i.e. grow for part of the forcing cycle via nucleation of new wavelengths of the pattern followed by wavelength annihilation during another part of the cycle. The breathing dynamics occur as the forcing parameter exits the region of stability of the localized pattern on either side and the fronts that define the edges of the state temporarily depin. The parameters of the forcing determine if there will be net growth, a balance, or net decay on average. A novel resonance phenomenon between the forcing period and the time required to nucleate one wavelength of the pattern outside the pinning region is identified. The resonances generate distinct regions in parameter space characterized by the net number of wavelengths gained or lost in one forcing cycle. Canard trajectories, in which the localized state follows an unstable solution branch for some amount of time before quickly jumping to a stable one, appear near the transitions between each region. In one dimension, the partitioning of the parameter space is well described by an asymptotic theory based on the wavelength nucleation/annihilation time near the boundaries of the region of stability. This theory leads to predictions that are qualitatively correct and, in some cases, provide quantitative agreement with numerical simulations. The underlying resonance mechanism is a more general phenomenon and is also studied in the context of coupled oscillator systems with a periodically modulated Adler equation as a simple model. A strikingly similar partitioning of the parameter space is observed, with the resonances occurring this time between the period of the frequency modulation and the time for the generation of a phase slip.},
