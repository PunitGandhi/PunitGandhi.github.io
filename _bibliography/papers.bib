      abstract = {In many drylands around the globe, vegetation self-organizes into regular spatial patterns in response to aridity stress. We consider the regularly-spaced vegetation bands, on gentle hill-slopes, that survive low rainfall conditions by harvesting additional stormwater from upslope low-infiltration bare zones. We are interested in the robustness of this pattern formation survival mechanism to changes in rainfall variability. For this, we use a flow-kick modeling framework that treats storms as instantaneous kicks to the soil water. The positive feedbacks in the storm-level hydrology, that act to concentrate water within the vegetation bands, are captured through the spatial profiles of the soil water kicks. Between storms, the soil water and vegetation, modeled by a two-component reaction-diffusion system, evolve together. We use a combination of linear stability analysis and numerical simulation to compare predictions of idealized periodic rainfall, with no variability, to predictions when there is randomness in the timing and magnitude of water input from storms. We show that including these random elements leads to a decrease in the parameter range over which patterns appear. This suggests that an increase in storm variability, even with the same mean annual rainfall, may negatively impact the resilience of these pattern-forming dryland ecosystems.}

abstract = {The accurate quantification of symmetry is a key goal in biological inquiries because symmetry can affect biological performance and can reveal insights into development and evolutionary history. Recently, we proposed a versatile measure of symmetry, transformation information (TI), which provides an entropy-based measure of deviations from exact symmetry with respect to a parameterized family of transformations. Here we develop this measure further to quantify approximate symmetries and maximal symmetries represented by critical points in TI as a function of a transformation parameter. This framework allows us to characterize the evolution of symmetry by tracking qualitative changes with respect to these critical points. We apply TI to increasingly complex settings, from mathematically tractable probability distributions to differential equation models with emergent behaviors that are inspired by developmental biology and formulated in both static and growing domains. Our analysis of the qualitative changes in symmetry properties indicates a potential pathway toward a general mathematical framework for characterizing symmetry transitions akin to bifurcation theory for dynamical systems. The results reveal deep connections between observed symmetry transitions, subtle changes in morphology, and the underlying mechanisms that govern the dynamics of the system.}

abstract = {Two identical van der Pol oscillators with mutual inhibition are considered as a conceptual framework for modeling a latching mechanism for cell cycle regulation. In particular, the oscillators are biased to a latched state in which there is a globally attracting steady-state equilibrium without coupling. The inhibitory coupling induces stable alternating large-amplitude oscillations that model the normal cell cycle. A homoclinic bifurcation within the model is found to be responsible for the transition from normal cell cycling to endocycles in which only one of the two oscillators undergoes large-amplitude oscillations.}

    abstract = { Abstract. We develop a model for investigating the impact of rainstorm variability on the formation of banded vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. Water input, during rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water. The redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the impact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed. These two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the fast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic reaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with soil water and biomass. This pulsed-precipitation model predicts that the preferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic distance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into the soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast ecohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation pattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain inputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland pattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical low annual mean. Model simulations suggest, for instance, that shorter rainy seasons and greater variability in storm depth may both hasten ecosystem collapse. }
